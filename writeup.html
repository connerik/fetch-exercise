                    AI was helpful when completing this assignment. When unsure of which Tailwind documentation to use, copilot was able to assist me in the proper formatting. The two LLM models that I tested for this exercise were Claude Haiku 4.5 and GPT-4o. To test the retention of code, I asked each model to switch the places of my top Animes and top characters lists. When asking Claude Haiku 4.5, the model did so quickly, but made a mistake which caused the Anime list to no longer display any data. However, with a simple follow-up request, the error was fixed. With GPT-4o, no mistakes were made, however the generation was slower, and unlike Claude Haiku 4.5, the code included no in-line comments to show where each segment was moved. Overall, I do not think I would have been able to achieve the end result of this site without the help of copilot, and I found it helpful in achieving the look that I wanted without having to spend as much time.
